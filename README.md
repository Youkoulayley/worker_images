This project aims to manage the images of the SÃ©rie-All website. But the project has been thinking with idea 
of being adapted to any other usages.
The worker images takes message from NATS, download the desired image, resize it and crop if necessary.

**Workflow of the worker** :

## NATS
A NATS streaming server is mandatory for the functioning of the worker_images.
The message send to the worker image need to have this format : 

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/5b0fcf2c5c1b5.jpg", 
  "name": "supergirl", 
  "crop_type": "poster", 
  "crop": "middle",
  "force_crop": "false"
}
```

The message contains different section :

* **URL**: The URL where to download the image ;
* **Name**: The name of the image when saved to the disk ;
* **Crop_type**: The type to use (show config.ini for more informations) ;
* **Crop**: The alignment of the crop ;
* **Force_crop**: If true, force the resize & crop, even if the fil exists.

## config.ini
Example : 

```
[DEFAULT]
images_folder = ../images
original_folder = %(images_folder)s/original
image_formats = {
    "poster": [
        "200_200",
        "300_300",
        "500_150"
        ],
    "banner": [
        "100_50"
    ]}

[LOGGING]
level = debug

[NATS]
cluster_id = serieall
connection_name = worker_images
channel = worker_images
```

## Development
Before starting to contribute to this project, you need to setup a NATS Streaming Server. A docker-compose file is present at the root of the repo for this purpose.
Just launch it : 
```bash
docker-compose up -d
``` 

Yo can test sending a message to NATS with the bin/nats_pub.py script.

## Tests
The project has unit tests and you need to pass all of them before your PR is validated.
Just run :
```bash 
make unittests
```
