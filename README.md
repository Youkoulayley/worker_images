This project aims to manage the images of the SÃ©rie-All website. But the project has been thinking with idea 
of being adapted to any other usages.
The worker images takes message from NATS, download the desired image, resize it and crop if necessary.

**Workflow of the worker** :

## NATS
A NATS streaming server is mandatory for the functioning of the worker_images.
The message send to the worker image need to have this format : 

```json
{
  "url": "https://www.thetvdb.com/banners/fanart/original/5b0fcf2c5c1b5.jpg", 
  "name": "supergirl", 
  "crop_type": "poster", 
  "crop": "middle",
  "force_crop": "false"
}
```

The message contains different section :

* **URL**: The URL where to download the image ;
* **Name**: The name of the image when saved to the disk ;
* **Crop_type**: The type to use (show config.ini for more informations) ;
* **Crop**: The alignment of the crop ;
* **Force_crop**: If true, force the resize & crop, even if the fil exists.

## config.ini

```
